    Project: Landing Page

Project Description:

    The goal of this project is to create an entire web page from the design the course provided, and to modify the content to your own design.
    
    To accomplish the project, I have used all the knowledge I have learned from the topics covered: 
        1. Introduction
        2. Prerequisites
        3. Git Basics
        4. HTML Foundations
        5. CSS Foundations
        6. Flexbox

    Also, I have used my researching skills to look for topics that was not yet covered in the course.
